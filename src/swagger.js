                        Signature for request validation. This header is used to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the request.   
                        The signature is generated using the following steps:  
                        1. Minify the JSON body: Remove null values while retaining the original formatting of the \`payer\` field.  
                        2. Hash the minified body: Use SHA-256 to hash the minified JSON body.  
                        3. Create a string: Format the string as \`HTTP_METHOD:ENDPOINT_URL:HASHED_BODY:TIMESTAMP\`.  
                        4. Sign the string: Use HMAC with SHA-256 and a secret key to sign the string.  
                        5. Encode the signature: The final signature is encoded in Base64.  
                          
                        This signature must be included in all requests to secure endpoints. Ensure that the timestamp is current to prevent replay attacks.
